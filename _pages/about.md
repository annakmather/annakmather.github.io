Hi there! I'm Anna, a Chicago based data scientist and data engineer. In the past I've worked as a consultant, helping progressive political and non profit organizations tackle their internal data problems. Currently, I work as a data engineer for SRAM, a bicycle components company. 

Outside of work, I'm a passionate cyclist, focusing on distance and gravel events. I ride for, and am a founding member of [The Dropettes](https://www.instagram.com/dropettes). When I'm not out exploring midwestern roads, I can be found knitting, taking the occassional guitar class, and spending time with my dog and friends.

I'd love to hear from you! Feel free to reach out via email.
